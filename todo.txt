test:
RPM -> test in real time using visualization
Coolant temp -> try out offset 0 and byte length 1 since obd also only returns 1 byte
Throttle position -> log raw data and compare against obd
cruise control buttons -> get clean can logs that hopefully contains some info


done:
Ignition status -> works
sleep when ignition off -> available in future update of Gauge.S
