test:
cruise control buttons -> get clean can logs that hopefully contains some info


done:
Ignition status -> works
sleep when ignition off -> available in future update of Gauge.S 
coolant -> works

not working:
RPM -> online sources are just plain wrong it seems like -> just use obd 
TPS -> online sources are just plain wrong it seems like -> just use obd
Speed -> online sources are just plain wrong it seems like -> just use obd
